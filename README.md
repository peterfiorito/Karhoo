# Karhoo Frontend Developer Assessment

## Getting Started

Install the required dependencies using npm:

```
npm install
```

You can then start the app with:

```
npm start
```

And run the tests (in watch mode) with:

```
npm test
```

## Summary
For the completed items, I just added a checkbox that gets the todo status from state (added the corresponding key to the todos).
For filters I just added a filter property in state, that we can reuse to whatever filter we want to apply. Right now we have only two,
but maybe later we want to also add aditional ones.
If I had more time, I would probably add more tests and check for more corner cases.

Feel free to check a more extensive ToDo list I did with React-Redux and TypeScript in: https://github.com/peterfiorito/TodoList-Typescript
