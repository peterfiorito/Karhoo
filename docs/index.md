# Karhoo Frontend Developer Technical Assessment

## Overview

Thanks for your interest in a development role on the Karhoo development team!

We'd like you to complete this short technical test before we bring you in for
an in person interview. It's a chance to show off your skills and show us how
you approach development.

This technical test is written in React and uses Redux for state management.
It assumes familiarity with React and Redux. If you aren't familiar with these
then let us know before starting the test!

You'll be working on a simple To Do app, extending it with a few new
features.
